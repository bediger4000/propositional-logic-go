# Propositional Logic Parser in Go
Read propositional logic expressions, and reprint them, Golang version

I was able to do a C-language, yacc and lex (bison and flex) 
[propositional logic expression parser](https://github.com/bediger4000/propositional-logic)
in a morning. I want to do a larger Golang project than self-replicating programs, or a small
Alpha-Beta minimaxing game. I'm rewriting the propositional logic expression parser in Go, with
the added fun of writing a lexer and parser by hand.
